# Physics L3 Computing Project:

## How to's:

****When first opening VS Code run the following command in the terminal****
```
    conda activate ppp
```

### Push to Github:
Save all files in VS Code

Once everything is saved put the following commands into the terminal

```
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push origin main
```
this pushes all files and changes to the Github Repository

NB **This only works if you've saved everything in VS Code** (If the icon in the top left has a number on it you have unsaved files)
