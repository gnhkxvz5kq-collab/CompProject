# Physics L3 Computing Project:

## How to's:

## Push to Github:
Save all files in VS
Once everything is saved put the following commands into the terminal

    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push origin main

this pushes all files and changes to the Github Repo
NB **This only works if you've saved everything in VS Code (If the icon in the top left has a number on it you have unsaved files)**
